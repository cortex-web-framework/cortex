## Decision Framework

### When Deciding What to Work On:

**Ask These Questions:**
1. Is it blocking other work? (→ Critical)
2. Do 80%+ of users need it? (→ Critical)
3. Does competition have it? (→ High)
4. Is there community demand? (→ High)
5. Does it differentiate us? (→ Medium)
6. Is it technically interesting? (→ Low)

### Evaluation Formula:
```
Priority = (Blocking + UserNeed + Competition + Demand) × (1 - Effort)
```
