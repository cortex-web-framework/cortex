## Project Goal
To continue the development of the Cortex Web Framework by implementing pending UI components, ensuring high quality through comprehensive testing and adherence to strict development principles (ZERO Dependencies, Clean Code, Super Strict TypeScript, TDD, Web Components Standard, Accessibility First, Mobile Responsive).

### Phase 1: Foundation & Immediate Fixes

#### Task 1.1: Verify `themeManager` Bug Fix
*   **Description**: Confirm that the `themeManager` deployment bug (Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'themeManager' has already been declared) is resolved after modifying `scripts/build-ui.js`.
*   **Steps**:
    1.  Trigger a new build and deployment of the UI components (if possible, or simulate the deployment environment locally).
    2.  Access the deployed application (or local simulation) in a browser.
    3.  Open the browser's developer console and check for the `Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'themeManager' has already been declared` error.
    4.  If the error persists, re-investigate the bundling process and `themeManager` declaration/usage.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: The `themeManager` error is no longer present in the browser console.

#### Task 1.2: Set Up Development Environment for New Component
*   **Description**: Prepare the environment for developing new UI components, starting with the Text Input Component.
*   **Steps**:
    1.  Ensure all necessary development tools (Node.js, npm/yarn, TypeScript compiler) are installed and configured.
    2.  Verify the project's `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.build-ui.json` are correctly set up for strict TypeScript compilation.
    3.  Familiarize with the existing component structure (e.g., `ui-button.ts`, `ui-checkbox.ts`) and testing patterns (`button-functionality.test.ts`).
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: Development environment is ready for TDD, and existing component structure is understood.

### Phase 2: Component Development - Text Input

#### Task 2.1: Design Text Input Component API
*   **Description**: Define the public API (attributes, properties, events, slots) for the `ui-text-input` component, adhering to Web Component standards and accessibility guidelines.
*   **Steps**:
    1.  Identify core functionalities: basic text input, placeholder, value, disabled state, read-only state, type (text, email, password, etc.), label association.
    2.  Consider common use cases and user interactions.
    3.  Define attributes for declarative usage (e.g., `placeholder`, `value`, `disabled`).
    4.  Define properties for programmatic access.
    5.  Define custom events (e.g., `input`, `change`, `focus`, `blur`).
    6.  Outline accessibility considerations (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: A clear, documented API for `ui-text-input` is defined.

#### Task 2.2: Implement Text Input Component (TDD)
*   **Description**: Develop the `ui-text-input` component using a strict TDD approach, ensuring zero dependencies and super strict TypeScript.
*   **Steps**:
    1.  **Red (Test First)**:
        *   Create `ui-text-input.test.ts` and write a failing test for the most basic functionality (e.g., component renders).
        *   Write tests for properties (e.g., `value`, `placeholder`).
        *   Write tests for events (e.g., `input`, `change`).
        *   Write tests for states (e.g., `disabled`, `readonly`).
        *   Write tests for accessibility (e.g., `aria-label`, keyboard interaction).
        *   Write tests for strict TypeScript type checking (ensure no `any` types are implicitly used).
    2.  **Green (Code to Pass)**:
        *   Create `ui-text-input.ts`.
        *   Implement the minimal HTML structure and CSS for the component.
        *   Implement properties and event handlers to make the tests pass.
        *   Ensure all code adheres to the "ZERO Dependencies" pledge.
        *   Ensure all code adheres to "Super Strict TypeScript" standards.
    3.  **Refactor**:
        *   Improve code structure, readability, and maintainability without breaking tests.
        *   Optimize CSS for consistency and performance.
        *   Ensure Shadow DOM is correctly implemented for style encapsulation.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: `ui-text-input` component is fully functional, all tests pass, and it adheres to all development principles.

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance & Refinement

#### Task 3.1: Integrate Text Input into `ui-bundle.js`
*   **Description**: Ensure the new `ui-text-input` component is correctly included in the `ui-bundle.js` without introducing new issues.
*   **Steps**:
    1.  Run the `scripts/build-ui.js` script.
    2.  Verify that `ui-text-input.js` (compiled from `ui-text-input.ts`) is included in the bundle.
    3.  Check the console for any new bundling errors.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: `ui-text-input` is part of the bundle, and no new bundling errors occur.

#### Task 3.2: Perform Initial QA for Text Input
*   **Description**: Conduct initial quality assurance checks for the `ui-text-input` component.
*   **Steps**:
    1.  **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
    2.  **Mobile Responsiveness**: Verify display and interaction on various screen sizes.
    3.  **Accessibility**: Manually check keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and ARIA attributes.
    4.  **Performance**: Basic check for rendering performance.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: `ui-text-input` functions correctly across target browsers, is responsive, accessible, and performs adequately.

### Phase 4: Iterative Component Development

#### Task 4.1: Prioritize Next Components
*   **Description**: Based on `remaining-todos.md` and `COMPONENT_PRIORITIZATION.md`, select the next set of components to develop.
*   **Steps**:

    2.  Prioritize based on dependencies or user impact (e.g., Textarea, Number Input, Select).
*   **Acceptance Criteria**: A clear list of the next 2-3 components to develop is established.

#### Task 4.2: Repeat Component Development Cycle
*   **Description**: For each prioritized component, repeat the process outlined in Phase 2 (Design API, Implement with TDD) and Phase 3 (Integrate, QA).
*   **Steps**:
    1.  For each component:
        *   Design API (similar to Task 2.1).
        *   Implement with TDD (similar to Task 2.2).
        *   Integrate into `ui-bundle.js` (similar to Task 3.1).
