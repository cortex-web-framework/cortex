# Cortex Framework Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This plan outlines the steps to implement the features and address the tasks identified in the `RESEARCH.md` document. The plan is divided into four main phases:

1.  **Project Setup and Testing Framework Migration:** Establish a solid foundation for development by migrating the testing framework.
2.  **Phased Feature Implementation:** Implement the core features of the Cortex Framework in a structured, phase-by-phase manner.
3.  **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Ensure the stability and correctness of the framework by implementing the testing strategy and fixing existing issues.
4.  **Documentation:** Create comprehensive documentation for developers and users.

## 2. Phase 1: Project Setup and Testing Framework Migration

**Goal:** Migrate the testing framework from `ts-node/esm` to a compile-first approach to eliminate experimental warnings and improve performance.

*   **Task 1.1: Create `tsconfig.test.json`**
    *   Create a new `tsconfig.test.json` file that extends the base `tsconfig.json`.
    *   Configure it to include all `*.ts` files in `src` and `tests`, and to output the compiled JavaScript to a `dist-tests` directory.
    *   Enable `sourceMap` for better debugging.

*   **Task 1.2: Update `package.json` Test Scripts**
    *   Modify the `test` script in `package.json` to first compile the tests using `tsc --project tsconfig.test.json` and then run the compiled tests from the `dist-tests` directory using `node --test`.
    *   Add separate scripts for compiling and running tests (e.g., `test:compile` and `test:run`).
    *   Add a `test:watch` script for development.

*   **Task 1.3: Validate the New Test Setup**
    *   Run the new `test` script and verify that all 262 tests are executed.
    *   Confirm that the 11 known test failures still fail and that no new tests are failing.
    *   Confirm that there are no "ExperimentalWarning" messages in the test output.

## 3. Phase 2: Phased Feature Implementation

**Goal:** Implement the core features of the framework as defined in the project's `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md`. All implementation should follow a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

*   **Sub-phase 2.1: Web3 Integration**
    *   Implement the `SmartContractClient` class in `src/web3/smartContracts.ts`.
    *   Implement the `IPFSClient` class in `src/web3/ipfs.ts`.
    *   Write unit and integration tests for both clients.

*   **Sub-phase 2.2: WebAssembly (Wasm) Integration**
    *   Implement Wasm loading and instantiation utilities in `src/wasm/utils.ts`.
    *   Modify the `WorkerActor` to support offloading computations to Wasm modules.
    *   Write tests for the Wasm utilities and the `WorkerActor` integration.

*   **Sub-phase 2.3: WebWorker & Web Threads Integration**
    *   Implement the `WorkerActor` base class in `src/workers/workerActor.ts`.
    *   Implement the `WorkerPool` class in `src/workers/workerPool.ts`.
    *   Write tests for the `WorkerActor` and `WorkerPool`.

*   **Sub-phase 2.4: Enhanced Security Features**
    *   Implement the `CSPBuilder` in `src/security/csp.ts`.
    *   Implement the rate-limiting middleware in `src/security/rateLimiter.ts`.
    *   Write tests for the security features.

*   **Sub-phase 2.5: Performance Boosting Features**
    *   Implement HTTP caching utilities in `src/performance/httpCache.ts`.
    *   Implement Brotli and Gzip compression middleware in `src/performance/compression.ts`.
    *   Write tests for the performance features.

*   **Sub-phase 2.6: Advanced API Technologies**
    *   Implement the basic GraphQL server in `src/api/graphql.ts`.
    *   Implement the basic gRPC server and client in `src/api/grpc.ts`.
    *   Write tests for the API technologies.

## 4. Phase 3: Testing and Quality Assurance

**Goal:** Ensure the framework is robust, reliable, and well-tested.

*   **Task 3.1: Implement Comprehensive Testing Strategy**
    *   Following `TEST_STRATEGY.md`, write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all implemented features.
    *   Aim for a test coverage of 90% or higher for all new code.

*   **Task 3.2: Fix Known Failing Tests**
    *   Investigate and fix the 11 known failing tests identified in the `TESTING_STRATEGY_SUMMARY.md`.

## 5. Phase 4: Documentation

**Goal:** Provide clear, comprehensive, and user-friendly documentation.

*   **Task 4.1: Update `README.md`**
    *   Add sections to the `README.md` file for all the new features, including Observability, Resilience, Web3, Wasm, etc.

*   **Task 4.2: Create Module-Specific Documentation**
    *   Create separate markdown files for each major feature area, explaining the architecture, usage, and configuration options.

*   **Task 4.3: Create Tutorials and Examples**
    *   Create example projects or code snippets demonstrating how to use the various features of the framework.
