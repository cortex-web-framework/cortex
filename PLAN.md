# Plan for Cortex UI Component Development

**Project Goal:** Develop a comprehensive UI component library for the Cortex framework, aiming for 150+ components, while adhering to UI/UX best practices and optimizing Developer Experience (DX).

This plan is structured into phases, emphasizing foundational setup, iterative development, and continuous improvement, integrating insights from the UI/UX and DX research.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Design System Establishment

### Step 1.1: Define Core Design Principles & Guidelines
*   **Objective:** Establish a foundational set of UI/UX principles (User-Centered Design, Usability, Consistency, Accessibility, etc.) that will guide all component development.
*   **Action:** Document core design principles, visual language (colors, typography, spacing, iconography), and interaction patterns.
*   **Output:** `DESIGN_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES.md` (or similar documentation).

### Step 1.2: Choose Component Technology Stack
*   **Objective:** Select the framework/library (e.g., Lit, React, Vue) and styling approach (e.g., CSS-in-JS, Web Components, utility-first CSS) for component implementation.
*   **Action:** Research and decide on the most suitable technologies that align with Cortex's architecture and DX goals.
*   **Output:** Decision documented in `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`.

### Step 1.3: Set Up Component Scaffolding & Build Process
*   **Objective:** Create a standardized way to generate new component files and a robust build process for the UI library.
*   **Action:** Implement a component generator (e.g., using Plop.js, custom script) and configure build tools (e.g., Rollup, Webpack, Vite) for efficient bundling, minification, and TypeScript compilation.
*   **Output:** Component generator script, updated `package.json` scripts, build configuration files.

### Step 1.4: Establish Testing Infrastructure
*   **Objective:** Set up a comprehensive testing environment for UI components.
*   **Action:** Configure unit testing (e.g., Jest, Vitest), integration testing (e.g., React Testing Library, Playwright), and visual regression testing (e.g., Storybook with Chromatic, Playwright with image snapshots).
*   **Output:** Test configuration files, example tests.

### Step 1.5: Set Up Documentation & Storybook
*   **Objective:** Create a living style guide and component documentation platform.
*   **Action:** Integrate Storybook (or similar) for component showcasing, interactive examples, and auto-generated documentation.
*   **Output:** Storybook setup, initial component stories.

## Phase 2: Component Prioritization & API Design

### Step 2.1: Prioritize Basic Input Controls & Buttons
*   **Objective:** Focus on foundational components that are used across almost all applications.
*   **Action:** Select the top 10-15 most critical basic input controls and button types from the `RESEARCH.md` list.
*   **Output:** Prioritized component list.

### Step 2.2: Define Component API & Props (for prioritized components)
*   **Objective:** Design intuitive and consistent APIs for the initial set of components, considering DX.
*   **Action:** For each prioritized component, define its props, events, slots (if using Web Components), and methods.
*   **Output:** API specifications (e.g., TypeScript interfaces, JSDoc comments).

## Phase 3: Iterative Component Development (Cycle for each prioritized component)

### Step 3.1: Implement Component Core Logic & Structure
*   **Objective:** Write the functional code for the component.
*   **Action:** Use the chosen technology stack to implement the component, focusing on modularity, reusability, and performance.
*   **Output:** Component source files (`.ts`, `.css`/styling).

### Step 3.2: Apply Styling & Theming
*   **Objective:** Style the component according to the design system guidelines and ensure theming capabilities.
*   **Action:** Implement CSS/styling, ensuring variables for theming (e.g., CSS custom properties).
*   **Output:** Component styling.

### Step 3.3: Develop Comprehensive Tests
*   **Objective:** Ensure component quality, reliability, and adherence to specifications.
*   **Action:** Write unit tests (for logic), integration tests (for interaction), and visual regression tests (for appearance).
*   **Output:** Test files (`.test.ts`).

### Step 3.4: Create Storybook Entry & Documentation
*   **Objective:** Document the component's usage, props, and examples.
*   **Action:** Create a Storybook story for the component, including interactive controls and usage examples. Write API documentation.
*   **Output:** Storybook story file, API documentation.

### Step 3.5: Review & Refine (Internal)
*   **Objective:** Ensure the component meets quality standards and design principles.
*   **Action:** Conduct internal code review and design review.
*   **Output:** Review feedback, component refinements.

## Phase 4: Expansion & Advanced Components

### Step 4.1: Develop Navigation & Data Display Components
*   **Objective:** Implement more complex components like Navbar, Tabs, Tables, and the foundational Data Grid.
*   **Action:** Repeat the iterative development cycle (Phase 3) for components in these categories.

### Step 4.2: Develop Form & Feedback Components
*   **Objective:** Implement form elements, validation, alerts, and toasts.
*   **Action:** Repeat the iterative development cycle (Phase 3) for components in these categories.

### Step 4.3: Develop Advanced/Composite Components
*   **Objective:** Implement complex components like Rich Text Editor, Charts, Maps, etc.
*   **Action:** Repeat the iterative development cycle (Phase 3) for components in these categories, potentially breaking down very large components (like the Data Grid) into smaller, manageable sub-components.

### Step 4.4: Achieve 150+ Component Target
*   **Objective:** Systematically work through the proposed component list, ensuring a diverse and comprehensive library.
*   **Action:** Continuously develop components, tracking progress against the 150+ target.

## Phase 5: Continuous Improvement & DX Optimization

### Step 5.1: Gather User Feedback (UI/UX & DX)
*   **Objective:** Collect feedback from designers, developers, and end-users.
*   **Action:** Conduct usability testing, developer surveys, and gather feedback through community channels.

### Step 5.2: Iterate on Components & Design System
*   **Objective:** Refine existing components and design system based on feedback and new insights.
*   **Action:** Prioritize and implement improvements, bug fixes, and new features for components.

### Step 5.3: Optimize Developer Experience (DX)
*   **Objective:** Continuously improve the ease of use, documentation, and tooling for developers.
*   **Action:** Enhance component APIs, improve error messages, streamline the development workflow, and expand documentation.
