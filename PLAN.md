## PLAN.md: Implementing Best Practices for Cortex Framework Development

## Phase 1: Git Branch Consolidation

### Goal
To consolidate all existing feature branches into the `develop` branch, ensuring a clean and linear history.

### Tasks

1.  **Identify Current Branch:** Determine the current active branch.
2.  **Checkout `develop`:** Switch to the `develop` branch.
3.  **Merge Feature Branches:** Sequentially merge each feature branch into `develop` using a rebase-and-merge or squash-and-merge strategy as appropriate. The recommended order from `RESEARCH.md` is:
    *   `feature/initial-setup`
    *   `feature/event-bus`
    *   `feature/actor-system`
    *   `feature/http-server`
    *   `feature/neurons`
    *   `feature/documentation`
    *   `feature/next-steps-research`
    *   `feature/next-steps-plan`
    *   `feature/next-steps-todo`
    *   `feature/new-functionalities-research`
    *   `feature/new-functionalities-todo`
    *   `feature/strict-typescript-research` (current branch, will be merged last)
4.  **Delete Merged Branches:** After successful merge, delete the feature branches.

## Phase 2: Apply Strict TypeScript Configuration

### Goal
To enforce the highest level of type safety across the entire codebase.

### Tasks

1.  **Update `tsconfig.json`:** Modify `tsconfig.json` with the recommended strict settings from `RESEARCH.md` (Section 2).

## Phase 3: Iterative Refactoring for Type Safety

### Goal
To eliminate all `any` types and resolve TypeScript compilation errors introduced by the strict configuration.

### Tasks

1.  **Address Compilation Errors:** Systematically go through the codebase and resolve all TypeScript compilation errors.
2.  **Eliminate `any` Types:** Replace all instances of `any` with explicit types, interfaces, or generics.
3.  **Apply TDD for Refactoring:** For complex type-related refactoring, follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
    *   Write a test that highlights the type issue (if applicable).
    *   Implement the type fix.
    *   Refactor for clarity and maintainability.

## Phase 4: Integrate Clean Code Principles and TDD for New Development

### Goal
To establish a development workflow that consistently applies clean code principles and Test-Driven Development.

### Tasks

1.  **Review Existing Code:** Conduct a review of existing code against clean code principles (meaningful names, small functions, etc.).
2.  **Establish TDD Workflow:** Ensure all new feature development or bug fixes strictly follow the Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle.
3.  **Automate Code Quality Checks:** Explore integrating linting and formatting tools (if not already present and adhering to zero-dependency) into the development workflow.
