    *   **TDD Workflow Implementation**: Maintaining a TDD workflow for all new component development.

## 5. Best Practices for Completion

To accomplish the remaining tasks while adhering to the project's strict principles, the following best practices should be employed:

### ZERO Dependencies
*   **Vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript**: Build all functionality using native browser APIs and core language features.
*   **Avoid Micro-Libraries**: Even small utility libraries should be avoided unless absolutely critical and thoroughly vetted for dependency-free implementation.
*   **Custom Utility Functions**: Implement necessary helper functions and utilities directly within the project.
*   **Leverage Web Standards**: Utilize Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and other native Web Component specifications to their fullest.

### Clean Code
*   **Readability**: Prioritize clear, self-documenting code. Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
*   **Modularity**: Break down components into small, focused, and reusable units.
*   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each component or module should have one clear responsibility.
*   **Consistency**: Maintain consistent coding style, formatting, and naming conventions across the entire codebase.
*   **Minimalism**: Write only the necessary code; avoid over-engineering.
*   **Comments (When Necessary)**: Use comments to explain *why* a piece of code exists or *what* a complex algorithm does, rather than *how* it works (which should be evident from the code itself).

### Super Strict TypeScript
*   **`tsconfig.json` Configuration**:
    *   `"strict": true`: Enable all strict type-checking options.
    *   `"noImplicitAny": true`: Flag expressions and declarations with an implied `any` type.
    *   `"strictNullChecks": true`: Enable strict null and undefined checks.
    *   `"strictFunctionTypes": true`: Enable strict checking of function types.
    *   `"strictPropertyInitialization": true`: Ensure class properties are initialized in the constructor.
    *   `"noImplicitReturns": true`: Report errors for functions that don't return a value on all code paths.
    *   `"noUnusedLocals": true`, `"noUnusedParameters": true`: Catch unused variables and parameters.
*   **Type Definitions**: Define clear and precise types for all component props, events, and internal state.
*   **Generics**: Use generics to create reusable and type-safe components.
*   **Type Guards**: Employ type guards for effective type narrowing.
*   **Linting**: Integrate ESLint with TypeScript rules to enforce type-related best practices.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
*   **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**:
    1.  **Red**: Write a failing test for a new piece of functionality.
    2.  **Green**: Write the minimum amount of code to make the test pass.
    3.  **Refactor**: Improve the code's design without changing its behavior, ensuring tests still pass.
*   **Unit Tests**: Write granular tests for individual functions, methods, and small component parts.
*   **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between different parts of a component or between multiple components.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: For critical user flows, use tools like Playwright or Cypress (if allowed, given zero-dependency pledge might restrict this, consider lighter alternatives or custom solutions) to simulate user interactions in a real browser environment.
*   **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, focusing on critical paths and complex logic.
*   **Mocking/Stubbing**: Use mocks and stubs to isolate units under test and manage dependencies.

### Web Components Standard
*   **Custom Elements**: Define custom elements for each UI component (e.g., `<ui-button>`).
*   **Shadow DOM**: Encapsulate component styles and DOM structure using Shadow DOM to prevent global style leakage and conflicts.
*   **Templates (`<template>` and `<slot>`)**: Utilize HTML templates and slots for reusable and flexible component structures.
*   **Attributes and Properties**: Clearly define how data flows into components via attributes (for declarative HTML) and properties (for JavaScript interaction).
*   **Events**: Design custom events for component interactions, allowing parent components to react to changes.

### Accessibility First
*   **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML5 semantic elements to convey meaning and structure.
*   **ARIA Attributes**: Apply ARIA roles, states, and properties where native HTML semantics are insufficient (e.g., for custom controls).
*   **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive components are fully navigable and operable using only the keyboard.
*   **Focus Management**: Implement proper focus management for modals, menus, and other interactive elements.
*   **Color Contrast**: Adhere to WCAG guidelines for color contrast to ensure readability.
*   **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Test components with screen readers to ensure all content and interactions are perceivable.

### Mobile Responsive
*   **Fluid Layouts**: Use flexible grid systems, flexbox, and relative units (%, `em`, `rem`, `vw`, `vh`) instead of fixed pixel values.
*   **Media Queries**: Employ CSS media queries to apply different styles based on screen size, orientation, and resolution.
*   **Viewport Meta Tag**: Ensure the `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` tag is correctly configured.
*   **Touch Targets**: Design interactive elements with sufficiently large touch targets for mobile users.
*   **Performance**: Optimize for mobile performance by minimizing bundle size, optimizing images, and reducing render-blocking resources.

By diligently applying these best practices, the project can achieve its goals of delivering a high-quality, zero-dependency, and strictly typed UI component library.
