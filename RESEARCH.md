# Research: Cortex Framework - Project Status and Roadmap

## 1. Overview

Based on the analysis of the project's markdown files, the Cortex Framework is a well-planned, zero-dependency actor framework for TypeScript. The initial research and planning phases are complete, and a significant amount of detailed implementation and testing strategy has been documented.

The project is now in the implementation phase. The remaining work can be categorized into three main areas: **Implementation**, **Testing**, and **Documentation**.

## 2. Remaining Tasks

### 2.1. Implementation Tasks

The implementation is divided into six phases as outlined in `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md`.

#### Phase 1: Web3 Integration
*   **Goal:** Interact with blockchain networks and decentralized storage.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Implement `SmartContractClient` in `src/web3/smartContracts.ts` for EVM-compatible chain interaction.
    *   Implement `IPFSClient` in `src/web3/ipfs.ts` for content addressing and retrieval.
*   **Approach:** Follow the detailed specifications in `IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` (lines for Web3 were not provided, but the pattern is clear).

#### Phase 2: WebAssembly (Wasm) Integration
*   **Goal:** Leverage Wasm for performance-critical tasks.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Implement Wasm loading and instantiation utilities in `src/wasm/utils.ts`.
    *   Extend `WorkerActor` to offload computations to Wasm modules.
*   **Approach:** Implement the `WasmMemoryManager` as specified in `IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` (lines 2440-2642) and integrate it with the `WorkerActor`.

#### Phase 3: WebWorker & Web Threads Integration
*   **Goal:** Improve responsiveness by offloading heavy computations to background threads.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Create `WorkerActor` base class in `src/workers/workerActor.ts`.
    *   Implement `WorkerPool` for managing worker actors in `src/workers/workerPool.ts`.
*   **Approach:** Replace the placeholder implementation in `src/workers/workerPool.ts` with a real implementation using Node.js `worker_threads` as specified in `IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` (lines 2655-2951).

#### Phase 4: Enhanced Security Features
*   **Goal:** Mitigate common web vulnerabilities.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Implement a `CSPBuilder` in `src/security/csp.ts`.
    *   Implement a rate-limiting middleware in `src/security/rateLimiter.ts`.
*   **Approach:** Follow the specifications in `IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md`.

#### Phase 5: Performance Boosting Features
*   **Goal:** Achieve high performance.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Implement HTTP caching utilities in `src/performance/httpCache.ts`.
    *   Implement Brotli and Gzip compression middleware in `src/performance/compression.ts`.
*   **Approach:** Replace the placeholder implementation in `src/performance/compression.ts` with a real streaming implementation using Node.js `zlib` module as specified in `IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` (lines 2112-2356).

#### Phase 6: Advanced API Technologies
*   **Goal:** Offer flexible and modern API capabilities.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Implement a basic GraphQL server in `src/api/graphql.ts`.
    *   Implement a basic gRPC server and client in `src/api/grpc.ts`.
*   **Approach:** Follow the specifications in `IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md`.

### 2.2. Testing Tasks

The project has a comprehensive testing strategy documented in `TEST_STRATEGY.md` and related files.

*   **Task 1: Migrate to Compile-First Testing**
    *   **Goal:** Eliminate `ts-node/esm` loader and its experimental warnings.
    *   **Approach:** Follow the detailed steps in `VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`. This involves creating a `tsconfig.test.json`, updating `package.json` scripts, and compiling tests to a `dist-tests` directory before running them with the native Node.js test runner.

*   **Task 2: Implement Test Scenarios**
    *   **Goal:** Achieve 90%+ test coverage for all new features.
    *   **Approach:** Implement the 200+ test scenarios identified in `TEST_STRATEGY.md` for Observability, Resilience, and the placeholder fixes. Use the examples in `TEST_EXAMPLES.md` as a starting point.

*   **Task 3: Fix Failing Tests**
    *   **Goal:** Resolve the 11 baseline test failures.
    *   **Approach:** Investigate each failing test listed in `TESTING_STRATEGY_SUMMARY.md`. The failures seem to be related to uncaught exceptions and module import issues (gRPC).

### 2.3. Documentation Tasks

*   **Goal:** Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for the framework.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Update `README.md` to include the new features.
    *   Create detailed documentation for each module (Observability, Resilience, etc.).
    *   Create tutorials and usage examples for all major features.

## 3. Best Approaches and Recommendations

### 3.1. Implementation Approach

*   **Follow the Plan:** Adhere to the phased implementation plan in `PLAN.md` and the detailed breakdown in `IMPLEMENTATION_BREAKDOWN.md`.
*   **TDD:** Follow a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach as outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Write tests before implementation.
*   **Zero-Dependency:** Continue to adhere to the zero-dependency principle for core modules.

### 3.2. Testing Approach

*   **Compile-First Migration:** Prioritize the migration to the compile-first testing approach. This will provide a stable foundation for future testing.
*   **Coverage:** Aim for the 90%+ coverage targets defined in `TEST_STRATEGY.md`.
*   **Automation:** Automate the test suite execution in a CI/CD pipeline as suggested in the documentation.

### 3.3. Project Management

*   **Use `TODO.md`:** Update the `TODO.md` file to track progress by marking tasks as complete.
*   **Commit Messages:** Use descriptive commit messages that reference the task being worked on (e.g., `feat(web3): Implement SmartContractClient`).

## 4. Conclusion

The Cortex Framework project is well-defined with a clear path forward. The immediate next steps should be:

1.  **Migrate the testing framework** to the compile-first approach.
2.  Begin **implementing the features** phase by phase, starting with Web3 integration.
3.  **Write tests concurrently** with the implementation, following the TDD methodology.

By following the existing documentation and plans, the project can be successfully implemented.
