# Research: Implementing the Cortex Website with the Cortex Framework

**STATUS: âœ… RESEARCH COMPLETE - IMPLEMENTATION FINISHED - October 27, 2025**

## 1. Overview

This research outlines the best approach to building the various components of the Cortex website, as specified in the provided design files (`@stitch_cortex_architecture_visualization.zip`), using the Cortex framework itself. The Cortex framework is a modular, actor-based system built with TypeScript, which is well-suited for building the different parts of the proposed website.

**Note:** All research-backed implementation has been completed successfully. Refer to [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) and [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for implementation details.

## 2. Core Cortex Framework Concepts

Before diving into the specific page implementations, it's important to understand the core concepts of the Cortex framework that will be used throughout the project:

*   **Actor Model:** For handling concurrent operations and managing state in a safe and isolated manner. This is ideal for backend services, data processing, and more.
*   **Event Bus:** For communication between different parts of the application. This will be used to create a loosely coupled and scalable architecture.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The framework is divided into modules for features like `Observability`, `Resilience`, `Security`, etc. This modularity will be reflected in the project structure.
*   **Built-in HTTP Server:** For creating RESTful APIs and serving web pages.
*   **TypeScript:** The entire framework is written in TypeScript, and the website should be as well to maintain consistency and type safety.

## 3. Page-by-Page Implementation Strategy

### 3.1. Homepage & General Structure

*   **Design:** The homepage designs (`cortex_home_page:_hero_&_features_1`, `cortex_home_page:_hero_&_features_2`) showcase a modern, visually appealing layout with a hero section, feature highlights, and clear calls to action.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   The frontend can be built using a modern web framework like React or Vue, or even with plain TypeScript and HTML, leveraging the provided Tailwind CSS styles.
    *   The backend can be a set of Cortex actors that provide data to the frontend, such as dynamic content for the feature highlights.
    *   The `CortexHttpServer` will be used to serve the homepage and other static pages.

### 3.2. Architecture Visualization

*   **Design:** The architecture visualizations (`cortex_architecture_visualization_1`, `cortex_architecture_visualization_2`) present a layered architecture with an API layer, feature modules, and a core layer.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   This page should be a visual representation of the Cortex framework's architecture as described in the `README.md`.
    *   The interactive elements from the design (hover effects, pop-ups) can be implemented using JavaScript/TypeScript on the frontend.
    *   The content for this page should be sourced from the framework's own documentation to ensure accuracy.

### 3.3. Blog / News Section

*   **Design:** The blog design (`cortex_blog_/_news`) shows a classic blog layout with a list of articles, a featured article, search, and filtering.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   A set of Cortex actors can be created to manage blog posts. For example, a `PostActor` could be responsible for creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts.
    *   The posts themselves can be stored in a database or as markdown files.
    *   The `CortexHttpServer` will expose a RESTful API for the frontend to fetch the blog posts.
    *   The search and filtering functionality can be implemented as another actor that queries the post data.

### 3.4. Code Examples Showcase

*   **Design:** The code example showcases (`cortex_code_examples_showcase_1`, `cortex_code_examples_showcase_2`) present code snippets with corresponding console outputs in a clean, readable format.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   This is a key section for a developer-focused website. The design should be implemented as closely as possible.
    *   The code examples should be real, working examples of Cortex features.
    *   The backend could have an actor for each example that, when triggered, runs the example code and captures the output. This would make the examples "live" and interactive.

### 3.5. Community & Contribution Page

*   **Design:** The community page (`cortex_community_&_contribution`) is designed to encourage community involvement with clear calls to action.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   This page will be mostly static content, but the links to GitHub issues, forums, and social media should be dynamic and configurable.
    *   The `Config` module of the Cortex framework can be used to manage these external links.

### 3.6. About Us / Team Page

*   **Design:** The "About Us" page (`cortex_about_us_/_team`) introduces the team behind the project.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   This is another mostly static page. The team member information can be stored in a configuration file or a simple data store and rendered on the page.

## 4. Technical Recommendations

*   **Language:** Use TypeScript for the entire project to align with the Cortex framework.
*   **Styling:** The designs use Tailwind CSS. This should be used for the frontend styling.
*   **Project Structure:** The project should be structured in a modular way, mirroring the Cortex framework's own structure. Create separate directories for different features (e.g., `src/blog`, `src/community`, etc.).
*   **Testing:** The Cortex framework has a strong emphasis on testing. The website should have a comprehensive test suite, including unit tests for actors and end-to-end tests for the UI.

## 5. Conclusion

The Cortex framework is perfectly capable of building the website as designed in the provided visualizations. By leveraging the framework's core features like the actor model, event bus, and modular architecture, we can build a scalable, maintainable, and performant website that also serves as a great showcase for the framework itself.
