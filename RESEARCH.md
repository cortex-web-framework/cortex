# Web Framework Documentation Research

## Executive Summary

This research analyzes the websites and documentation of popular web frameworks to identify best practices for improving the Cortex documentation. The key takeaway is that a successful developer experience hinges on a clear value proposition, a structured learning path, and a focus on community and practical application. We recommend a complete overhaul of the Cortex documentation to incorporate these findings.

## Common Themes and Best Practices

Across the analyzed frameworks, several common themes and best practices emerged:

*   **Clear Value Proposition:** Every successful framework has a clear and concise value proposition on its homepage. This is often a catchy tagline that communicates the framework's primary benefit.
*   **Structured Learning Path:** The best documentation sites provide a structured learning path for new users. This usually starts with a "Getting Started" guide or a "Quick Start" tutorial.
*   **Interactive Examples and Playgrounds:** Interactive code examples and playgrounds are highly effective for teaching and allow users to experiment without a local setup.
*   **Separation of Tutorials and API Reference:** Tutorials and conceptual guides should be separate from the API reference. This allows users to learn at their own pace and easily look up specific API details when needed.
*   **Community Focus:** Successful frameworks foster a sense of community by highlighting community resources, events, and contributors.
*   **Social Proof:** Testimonials, developer satisfaction surveys, and logos of companies using the framework are powerful forms of social proof.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:** Information should be presented in a way that doesn't overwhelm beginners. Advanced topics should be introduced gradually.
*   **Modern and Clean Design:** A modern, clean, and well-designed website is crucial for a positive developer experience.

## Recommendations for Cortex

Based on this research, we recommend the following for the Cortex documentation:

1.  **Develop a Clear Value Proposition:** Create a clear and concise tagline for Cortex that communicates its primary benefit.
2.  **Create a Structured "Learn" Section:**  Develop a structured, tutorial-style "Learn" section that guides new users through the process of building their first Cortex application.
3.  **Build an Interactive Playground:** Create an interactive playground where users can experiment with Cortex in their browser.
4.  **Separate Tutorials from API Reference:**  Create a dedicated API reference section that is separate from the tutorials and conceptual guides.
5.  **Showcase the Cortex Community:**  Create a community section that highlights community resources, contributors, and events.
6.  **Add Social Proof:**  Collect testimonials from users and showcase companies that are using Cortex.
7.  **Redesign the Website:**  Undertake a complete redesign of the Cortex website to create a modern, clean, and user-friendly experience.
8.  **Create "Cortex for X Developers" Guides:**  Create guides for developers who are coming to Cortex from other frameworks (e.g., "Cortex for React Developers").
