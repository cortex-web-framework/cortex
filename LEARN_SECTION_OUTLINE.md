# "Learn" Section Outline

This document outlines the proposed structure for the new "Learn" section of the Cortex documentation.

## Part 1: Getting Started

This section is for developers who are new to Cortex. It will guide them through the process of setting up their first Cortex application.

*   **1.1. Introduction:** What is Cortex? Why use it?
*   **1.2. Quick Start:** A 5-minute guide to getting a Cortex app running.
*   **1.3. Installation:** Detailed installation instructions for different operating systems.
*   **1.4. Creating Your First App:** A step-by-step guide to creating a "Hello, World!" application.
*   **1.5. Project Structure:** An explanation of the default project structure of a Cortex application.

## Part 2: Core Concepts

This section will provide a deep dive into the core concepts of Cortex.

*   **2.1. Components:** How to create and use components.
*   **2.2. State Management:** How to manage state in a Cortex application.
*   **2.3. Routing:** How to handle routing and navigation.
