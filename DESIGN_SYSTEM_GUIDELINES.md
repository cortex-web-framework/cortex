# Cortex Design System Guidelines

These guidelines establish the foundational UI/UX principles and visual language for all UI component development within the Cortex framework. Adherence to these principles ensures consistency, usability, and an optimal developer experience.

## Core UI/UX Principles

Derived from scientific research on UI/UX best practices:

1.  **User-Centered Design (UCD):**
    *   **Principle:** Always design with the end-user in mind. Understand their needs, behaviors, and motivations.
    *   **Application:** Component APIs, visual design, and interaction patterns should directly address user workflows and pain points. Utilize user research, personas, and journey maps.

2.  **Usability:**
    *   **Principle:** Components must be easy to understand, learn, and use effectively and efficiently.
    *   **Application:** Minimize cognitive load, provide clear affordances, ensure intuitive navigation, and allow users to accomplish tasks with minimal effort.

3.  **Simplicity (KISS Principle - Keep It Simple, Stupid):**
    *   **Principle:** Prioritize simple, straightforward solutions over overly complex ones.
    *   **Application:** Component APIs should be concise. Visual designs should be clean and uncluttered. Avoid unnecessary features or configurations that add complexity without significant value.

4.  **Clear Workflow & Feedback:**
    *   **Principle:** Components should support clear, logical user workflows and provide immediate, understandable feedback.
    *   **Application:** Design components to guide users through tasks. Provide visual and textual feedback for user actions, system states (loading, success, error), and interactive elements.

5.  **Consistency:**
    *   **Principle:** Maintain a consistent visual language, interaction patterns, and API design across all components.
    *   **Application:** Use a unified color palette, typography scale, spacing system, and iconography. Ensure similar components behave and look alike. Consistent API naming and structure enhance DX.

6.  **Accessibility:**
    *   **Principle:** Design and implement components to be usable by everyone, including individuals with disabilities.
    *   **Application:** Adhere to WCAG guidelines. Ensure proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA attributes, and sufficient color contrast.

7.  **Performance:**
    *   **Principle:** Components should be performant, loading quickly and responding smoothly to user interactions.
    *   **Application:** Optimize rendering, minimize bundle size, and avoid unnecessary re-renders. Implement lazy loading where appropriate.

## Visual Language

### Colors
*   **Primary Palette:** Define primary brand colors for interactive elements, calls to action, and key branding.
*   **Secondary Palette:** Define secondary colors for complementary actions and visual hierarchy.
*   **Grayscale Palette:** Establish a range of grays for text, borders, backgrounds, and disabled states.
*   **Semantic Colors:** Define colors for success, warning, error, and informational states.

### Typography
*   **Font Families:** Specify primary and secondary font families.
*   **Font Sizes:** Define a scalable type system (e.g., `xs`, `sm`, `base`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, etc.) for headings, body text, and smaller elements.
*   **Line Heights & Letter Spacing:** Establish consistent values for readability.
*   **Font Weights:** Define usage for different weights (e.g., regular, medium, bold).

### Spacing
*   **Spacing Scale:** Define a consistent, incremental spacing scale (e.g., `0`, `px`, `0.5`, `1`, `1.5`, `2`, etc. in rem or px) for margins, paddings, and gaps between elements.

### Iconography
*   **Icon Set:** Choose or design a consistent icon set.
*   **Sizing:** Define standard icon sizes.
*   **Usage:** Provide guidelines for icon placement and interaction.

### Borders & Shadows
*   **Border Radii:** Define standard border radii for elements (e.g., `none`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `full`).
*   **Border Widths & Colors:** Establish consistent border styles.
*   **Shadows (Elevation):** Define a system for shadows to indicate elevation and hierarchy.

## Interaction Patterns

*   **Hover, Focus, Active States:** Define consistent visual feedback for interactive states.
*   **Disabled States:** Clearly indicate disabled components.
*   **Loading States:** Provide consistent loading indicators.
*   **Error Handling:** Standardize how errors are displayed and communicated.

## Developer Experience (DX) Principles

Derived from scientific research on DX:

1.  **Intuitive APIs:**
    *   **Principle:** Component APIs should be easy to understand, remember, and use correctly.
    *   **Application:** Use clear, descriptive naming conventions. Provide sensible defaults. Minimize the number of required props. Leverage TypeScript for strong typing and auto-completion.

2.  **Clear & Comprehensive Documentation:**
    *   **Principle:** Documentation is a first-class citizen and crucial for developer productivity.
    *   **Application:** Every component must have clear, up-to-date documentation including usage examples, prop tables, and interactive demos (e.g., via Storybook). Explain *why* a component exists and *how* to use it effectively.

3.  **Streamlined Development Workflow:**
    *   **Principle:** Reduce friction in the development process, from component creation to testing and deployment.
    *   **Application:** Provide scaffolding tools for new components. Ensure fast build times and efficient hot-reloading. Integrate seamlessly with common development environments.

4.  **Testability:**
    *   **Principle:** Components should be easy to test at various levels (unit, integration, visual).
    *   **Application:** Design components with testability in mind. Provide clear testing guidelines and examples. Ensure test infrastructure is robust and easy to use.

5.  **Modularity & Reusability:**
    *   **Principle:** Components should be self-contained, focused on a single responsibility, and easily composable.
    *   **Application:** Avoid tight coupling. Design for clear separation of concerns. Promote composition over inheritance.

6.  **Helpful Error Messages:**
    *   **Principle:** When things go wrong, provide developers with clear, actionable error messages.
    *   **Application:** Implement custom error messages where appropriate, guiding developers to solutions rather than just reporting failures.

By adhering to these Design System Guidelines, Cortex will empower developers to build high-quality, consistent, and user-friendly applications efficiently.
