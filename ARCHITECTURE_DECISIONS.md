# Architecture Decisions for Cortex UI Component Library

This document outlines key architectural decisions made for the development of the Cortex UI Component Library, focusing on the chosen component technology stack and styling approach.

## 1. Component Technology Stack: Lit (LitElement)

**Decision:** The Cortex UI Component Library will be built using **Lit** (specifically LitElement for defining Web Components).

**Rationale:**
*   **Web Components Standard:** Lit natively builds on the Web Components standard, ensuring framework-agnostic components that can be used across any JavaScript framework (React, Angular, Vue, or plain HTML/JavaScript) or no framework at all. This provides maximum flexibility and future-proofing for the Cortex ecosystem.
*   **Lightweight & Performant:** Lit is a very lightweight library, contributing to fast loading times and efficient rendering. This aligns with the goal of building performant applications.
*   **Excellent Developer Experience (DX):** Lit offers an intuitive and efficient developer experience, especially when combined with TypeScript. Its declarative templating and reactive properties simplify component development.
*   **TypeScript Integration:** Lit has first-class TypeScript support, enabling strong typing, improved code quality, and better maintainability, which is crucial for a large component library.
*   **Encapsulation:** Leveraging Shadow DOM, Lit components provide strong encapsulation of their internal structure and styles, preventing style leakage and conflicts in complex applications.

**Alternatives Considered:**
*   **React, Angular, Vue:** While powerful, these are application frameworks. Building a UI *library* directly with them would tie Cortex users to a specific framework, limiting flexibility. Web Components provide a more universal solution.
*   **Stencil:** A strong contender for Web Component generation, offering performance optimizations. However, Lit was chosen for its slightly simpler API and direct approach to Web Component creation, which is often preferred for libraries where direct Web Component usage is the primary goal.
*   **Lightning Web Components (LWC):** Enterprise-grade and performant, but more tightly integrated with the Salesforce ecosystem, making it less suitable for a general-purpose framework like Cortex.

## 2. Styling Approach: CSS Custom Properties with Internal CSS

**Decision:** The styling approach for Cortex UI components will combine **CSS Custom Properties (Variables) for external theming and customization** with **internal CSS within the Shadow DOM for default component styles**.

**Rationale:**
*   **Strong Encapsulation (Shadow DOM):** By default, styles defined within a Lit component's Shadow DOM are encapsulated, preventing them from affecting the rest of the page and vice-versa. This ensures component visual integrity.
*   **Flexible Theming (CSS Custom Properties):** CSS Custom Properties provide a robust and developer-friendly mechanism for external theming. Users can define variables (e.g., `--cortex-primary-color`) at a global or parent level, and components can consume these variables to apply consistent theming. This offers a clear and powerful API for customization without breaking encapsulation.
*   **Maintainable Default Styles:** Internal CSS within the Shadow DOM allows component authors to define sensible default styles that ensure the component looks good out-of-the-box, reducing the need for extensive user customization for basic use cases.
*   **Developer Experience (DX):** This approach offers a clear separation of concerns: component authors control default appearance, while consumers control theming. The API for customization is explicit and well-documented (via CSS Custom Properties), enhancing DX.
*   **Accessibility:** Consistent theming through CSS Custom Properties can help maintain accessibility standards (e.g., color contrast) across different themes.

**Implementation Details:**
*   Components will define their default styles using standard CSS within `<style>` tags inside their Shadow DOM.
*   Theming will be exposed primarily through CSS Custom Properties, which components will use (e.g., `var(--cortex-primary-color, #007bff)`).
*   `::part()` pseudo-elements may be used sparingly to expose specific internal elements for advanced external styling if a strong use case arises.

**Alternatives Considered:**
*   **CSS-in-JS Libraries (e.g., Styled Components, Emotion):** While popular in React/Vue ecosystems, they add a layer of abstraction and runtime overhead that might not be ideal for lightweight Web Components. They can also complicate Shadow DOM integration.
*   **Utility-First CSS (e.g., Tailwind CSS):** Could be used for internal component styling, but would still require CSS Custom Properties for external theming. The overhead of including a utility-first framework for every component might outweigh the benefits for a core library.
