## 📈 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current (Will Address in v1.1)
1. **Test Failures** - Some edge case tests failing in GitHub Actions
   - Setup GitHub Pages workflow needs refinement
   - Testing framework needs optimization for CI environment

2. **Community Links** - Placeholder URLs in website
   - Discord link not configured
   - Twitter handle not set
   - GitHub link functional but can be enhanced

3. **Playground** - Not fully implemented
   - JavaScript editor loads but needs content
   - No execution environment yet

### Design Decisions
- Documentation served from GitHub markdown (not static HTML)
  - Pro: Always up-to-date with source
  - Pro: Reduces website build complexity
  - Con: Requires leaving website to read docs
