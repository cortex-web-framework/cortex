## ACT.md Log

### 2025-10-24 - Implementation Start

**Action:** Reviewed `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md`.
**Status:** Phase 1 of the plan, "Environmental and System-Level Configuration," requires direct user action and cannot be performed by the agent. The user needs to complete these steps on their operating system before the agent can proceed with Phase 2 (Codebase Analysis and Modification).

### 2025-10-24 - User Feedback: No `systemctl`

**Action:** User reported that `systemctl` is not available on their system. This impacted Step 1.2 (Verify and Manage D-Bus Service Status) and Step 1.3 (Verify and Manage `UPower` Service Status) of the `TODO.md`.
**Status:** Researched alternatives to `systemctl` for managing D-Bus and UPower services. Updated `TODO.md` to include these alternatives and considerations for systems without `systemctl`.

### 2025-10-24 - User Feedback: Debian WSL Context and Request for Fail-Safe UI Testing

**Action:** User clarified that the environment is Debian WSL and questioned the current UI testing approach due to persistent D-Bus errors, asking for a more "fail-safe" approach or to get rid of the tests. This changes the scope of the task from merely fixing D-Bus errors to re-evaluating the UI testing strategy in a WSL environment.
**Status:** Researched alternative UI testing strategies for WSL/headless environments that are less prone to D-Bus issues. Updated `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md` with a revised plan.

### 2025-10-24 - User Choice: Option A (Leverage WSL2 with WSLg)

**Action:** User chose Option A: Leverage WSL2 with WSLg. User also asked how to check WSL version.
**Status:** Provided instructions to check WSL version. Proceeding with Phase 2, Step 2.A.1 based on user's choice.

### 2025-10-24 - Phase 2.A.1: Verify Existing UI Test Setup is Compatible

**Action:** Read `scripts/test-ui.js` to understand its D-Bus and Xvfb setup. Identified custom D-Bus and Xvfb initializations that might conflict with WSLg. The script explicitly starts `dbus-daemon` and `Xvfb` if `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` and `DISPLAY` environment variables are not already set. It also uses `--no-sandbox` for Chrome.
**Status:** Modified `scripts/test-ui.js` to conditionally skip the D-Bus and Xvfb setup if WSLg is detected (i.e., `process.env.DISPLAY` and `process.env.DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` are already set).

### 2025-10-24 - Phase 3.1: Re-run UI Tests (Verification Failed - Initial Attempt)

**Action:** Re-ran UI tests after modifying `scripts/test-ui.js` for WSLg compatibility.
**Status:** D-Bus errors are still present. The script's conditional check for WSLg (`process.env.DISPLAY && process.env.DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`) did not prevent the manual D-Bus session from starting, indicating that `process.env.DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` was not set. This suggests an issue with WSLg environment variable propagation or an insufficient detection logic.

### 2025-10-24 - Phase 2.A.1 (Refinement): Verify Existing UI Test Setup is Compatible

**Action:** Refined the WSLg detection logic in `scripts/test-ui.js` to include `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and ensure D-Bus and Xvfb setup is only performed if WSLg is not active AND the environment variables are not set.
**Status:** Code modified. Proceeding to re-run tests for verification.

### 2025-10-24 - Phase 3.1: Re-run UI Tests (Verification Failed - Refined Attempt)

**Action:** Re-ran UI tests after refining WSLg compatibility changes in `scripts/test-ui.js`.
**Status:** The script now correctly detects "âœ… WSLg detected. Relying on WSLg for D-Bus and Xvfb." However, D-Bus errors are *still* present in the Chrome output. New errors like "Failed to connect to the bus: Could not parse server address: Unknown address type" appeared alongside the existing "Failed to connect to socket /run/dbus/system_bus_socket: No such file or directory". This indicates that Chrome itself is encountering D-Bus connection issues within the WSLg environment, even when the script is not manually setting up D-Bus.

### 2025-10-24 - Phase 2.A.1 (D-Bus Error Suppression): Verify Existing UI Test Setup is Compatible

**Action:** Modified `scripts/test-ui.js` to set `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS="disabled:"` before launching Chrome to suppress D-Bus errors from Chrome itself.
**Status:** Code modified. Proceeding to re-run tests for verification.

### 2025-10-24 - Phase 3.1: Re-run UI Tests (Verification Failed - D-Bus Suppression Attempt)

**Action:** Re-ran UI tests after attempting to suppress D-Bus errors in Chrome by setting `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS="disabled:"`.
**Status:** D-Bus errors are *still* present in the Chrome output, indicating that this environment variable setting is not fully effective at silencing all D-Bus related messages from Chrome. The tests still pass, but the error messages persist.

### 2025-10-24 - Phase 2.A.1 (Stderr Redirection): Verify Existing UI Test Setup is Compatible

**Action:** Modified `scripts/test-ui.js` to redirect Chrome's stderr to `/dev/null` to suppress D-Bus error messages.
**Status:** Code modified. Proceeding to re-run tests for verification.

### 2025-10-24 - Phase 3.1: Re-run UI Tests (Verification Successful)

**Action:** Re-ran UI tests after redirecting Chrome's stderr to `/dev/null`.
**Status:** D-Bus errors are no longer appearing in the output. The tests passed successfully. This effectively silences the non-critical D-Bus error messages from Chrome.

### 2025-10-24 - Phase 1.1 (Git Cleanup): Get Current Branch Status

**Action:** Executed `git status` to get an overview of the current working directory.
**Status:** Identified local branch `main` ahead of `origin/main` by 10 commits. Found modified files (`ACT.md`, `PLAN.md`, `RESEARCH.md`, `TEST.md`, `TODO.md`, various `.js` and `tsconfig.json` files) and many untracked `.js` files (likely compiled output).

### 2025-10-24 - Phase 1.1 (Git Cleanup): Update .gitignore

**Action:** Reviewed `.gitignore` and added patterns to ignore `src/**/*.js` files. Removed `scripts/**/*.js` from `.gitignore` so that test-ui.js is tracked.
**Status:** `.gitignore` updated. The `git add` command failed due to `scripts/test-ui.js` being ignored. Corrected `.gitignore` by removing `scripts/**/*.js` from ignore rules.
