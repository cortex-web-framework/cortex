# Getting Started with Cortex

## 1.1. Introduction

Welcome to Cortex! Cortex is a complete framework for building modern web applications. It is designed to be fast, productive, and easy to use. Whether you are building a small personal project or a large-scale enterprise application, Cortex has the tools you need to get the job done.

Cortex is built on a foundation of modern web technologies and best practices. It provides a powerful set of features for building user interfaces, managing state, handling routing, and more. With Cortex, you can focus on writing your application's logic without getting bogged down in boilerplate code.

## 1.2. Quick Start

This 5-minute guide will get you up and running with your first Cortex application.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js 18 or higher
*   npm or yarn

### Create a New Cortex App

To create a new Cortex app, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm create cortex-app@latest my-app
```

This will create a new directory called `my-app` with a new Cortex application.

### Start the Development Server

Navigate into your new app's directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser to see your new Cortex application.

### Next Steps

Now that you have your first Cortex application running, you can start exploring the framework in more detail. The next section, "Creating Your First App," will guide you through the process of building a simple "Hello, World!" application.
