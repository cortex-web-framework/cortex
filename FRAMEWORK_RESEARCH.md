## Conclusion

This research establishes that **Cortex has significant unrealized potential** as an enterprise-grade, actor-model-based TypeScript framework. The current foundation is solid, but critical gaps in database integration, DI container, and authentication prevent adoption.

**The proposed 4-phase roadmap** addresses these gaps systematically while leveraging Cortex's unique strengths in distributed systems, observability, and resilience patterns.

**Expected Timeline:** 18-24 months to reach feature parity with leading frameworks and establish strong market position.

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. Prioritize Phase 1 items ruthlessly (DI, DB, Auth)
2. Maintain code quality and test coverage
3. Document every feature comprehensively
4. Engage community early and often
5. Provide clear migration paths from other frameworks
