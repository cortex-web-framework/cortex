# TODO List: Cortex UI Component Development

**Project Goal:** Develop a comprehensive UI component library for the Cortex framework, aiming for 150+ components, while adhering to UI/UX best practices and optimizing Developer Experience (DX).

## Phase 1: Foundation & Design System Establishment

*   [agent][design] **Step 1.1: Define Core Design Principles & Guidelines**
    *   Document core design principles, visual language (colors, typography, spacing, iconography), and interaction patterns.
    *   **Output:** `DESIGN_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES.md`.

*   [agent][research] **Step 1.2: Choose Component Technology Stack**
    *   Research and decide on the most suitable technologies (framework/library, styling approach) that align with Cortex's architecture and DX goals.
    *   **Output:** Decision documented in `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`.

*   [agent][tooling] **Step 1.3: Set Up Component Scaffolding & Build Process**
    *   Implement a component generator (e.g., using Plop.js, custom script).
    *   Configure build tools (e.g., Rollup, Webpack, Vite) for efficient bundling, minification, and TypeScript compilation.
    *   **Output:** Component generator script, updated `package.json` scripts, build configuration files.

*   [agent][tooling] **Step 1.4: Establish Testing Infrastructure**
    *   Configure unit testing (e.g., Jest, Vitest).
    *   Configure integration testing (e.g., React Testing Library, Playwright).
    *   Configure visual regression testing (e.g., Storybook with Chromatic, Playwright with image snapshots).
    *   **Output:** Test configuration files, example tests.

*   [agent][tooling] **Step 1.5: Set Up Documentation & Storybook**
    *   Integrate Storybook (or similar) for component showcasing, interactive examples, and auto-generated documentation.
    *   **Output:** Storybook setup, initial component stories.

## Phase 2: Component Prioritization & API Design

*   [agent][design] **Step 2.1: Prioritize Basic Input Controls & Buttons**
    *   Select the top 10-15 most critical basic input controls and button types from the `RESEARCH.md` list.
    *   **Output:** Prioritized component list.

*   [agent][design] **Step 2.2: Define Component API & Props (for prioritized components)**
    *   For each prioritized component, define its props, events, slots, and methods.
    *   **Output:** API specifications (e.g., TypeScript interfaces, JSDoc comments).

## Phase 3: Iterative Component Development (Cycle for each prioritized component)

*   [agent][code] **Step 3.1: Implement Component Core Logic & Structure**
    *   Write the functional code for the component.
    *   **Output:** Component source files (`.ts`, `.css`/styling).

*   [agent][code] **Step 3.2: Apply Styling & Theming**
    *   Implement CSS/styling, ensuring variables for theming.
    *   **Output:** Component styling.

*   [agent][test] **Step 3.3: Develop Comprehensive Tests**
    *   Write unit tests, integration tests, and visual regression tests.
    *   **Output:** Test files (`.test.ts`).

*   [agent][docs] **Step 3.4: Create Storybook Entry & Documentation**
    *   Create a Storybook story for the component, including interactive controls and usage examples.
    *   Write API documentation.
    *   **Output:** Storybook story file, API documentation.

*   [agent][review] **Step 3.5: Review & Refine (Internal)**
    *   Conduct internal code review and design review.
    *   **Output:** Review feedback, component refinements.

## Phase 4: Expansion & Advanced Components

*   [agent][code] **Step 4.1: Develop Navigation & Data Display Components**
    *   Repeat the iterative development cycle (Phase 3) for components in these categories.

*   [agent][code] **Step 4.2: Develop Form & Feedback Components**
    *   Repeat the iterative development cycle (Phase 3) for components in these categories.

*   [agent][code] **Step 4.3: Develop Advanced/Composite Components**
    *   Repeat the iterative development cycle (Phase 3) for components in these categories, potentially breaking down very large components (like the Data Grid) into smaller, manageable sub-components.

*   [agent][tracking] **Step 4.4: Achieve 150+ Component Target**
    *   Continuously develop components, tracking progress against the 150+ target.

## Phase 5: Continuous Improvement & DX Optimization

*   [agent][feedback] **Step 5.1: Gather User Feedback (UI/UX & DX)**
    *   Conduct usability testing, developer surveys, and gather feedback through community channels.

*   [agent][refine] **Step 5.2: Iterate on Components & Design System**
    *   Prioritize and implement improvements, bug fixes, and new features for components.

*   [agent][dx] **Step 5.3: Optimize Developer Experience (DX)**
    *   Enhance component APIs, improve error messages, streamline the development workflow, and expand documentation.
