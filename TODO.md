## TODO.md: Implementing Best Practices for Cortex Framework Development

## Phase 1: Git Branch Consolidation
*   `[git]` Identify current active branch.
*   `[git]` Checkout `develop` branch.
*   `[git]` Merge `feature/initial-setup` into `develop` (rebase/squash).
*   `[git]` Merge `feature/event-bus` into `develop` (rebase/squash).
*   `[git]` Merge `feature/actor-system` into `develop` (rebase/squash).
*   `[git]` Merge `feature/http-server` into `develop` (rebase/squash).
*   `[git]` Merge `feature/neurons` into `develop` (rebase/squash).
*   `[git]` Merge `feature/documentation` into `develop` (rebase/squash).
*   `[git]` Merge `feature/next-steps-research` into `develop` (rebase/squash).
*   `[git]` Merge `feature/next-steps-plan` into `develop` (rebase/squash).
*   `[git]` Merge `feature/next-steps-todo` into `develop` (rebase/squash).
*   `[git]` Merge `feature/new-functionalities-research` into `develop` (rebase/squash).
*   `[git]` Merge `feature/new-functionalities-todo` into `develop` (rebase/squash).
*   `[git]` Merge `feature/strict-typescript-research` into `develop` (rebase/squash).
*   `[git]` Merge `feature/best-practices-todo` into `develop` (rebase/squash).
*   `[git]` Merge `feature/150-new-functionalities` into `develop` (rebase/squash).
*   `[git]` Merge `feature/best-practices-todo-2` into `develop` (rebase/squash).
*   `[git]` Merge `feature/web-dev-trends-research` into `develop` (rebase/squash).
*   `[git]` Delete `feature/initial-setup` branch.
*   `[git]` Delete `feature/event-bus` branch.
*   `[git]` Delete `feature/actor-system` branch.
*   `[git]` Delete `feature/http-server` branch.
*   `[git]` Delete `feature/neurons` branch.
*   `[git]` Delete `feature/documentation` branch.
*   `[git]` Delete `feature/next-steps-research` branch.
*   `[git]` Delete `feature/next-steps-plan` branch.
*   `[git]` Delete `feature/next-steps-todo` branch.
*   `[git]` Delete `feature/new-functionalities-research` branch.
*   `[git]` Delete `feature/new-functionalities-todo` branch.
*   `[git]` Delete `feature/strict-typescript-research` branch.
*   `[git]` Delete `feature/best-practices-todo` branch.
*   `[git]` Delete `feature/150-new-functionalities` branch.
*   `[git]` Delete `feature/best-practices-todo-2` branch.
*   `[git]` Delete `feature/web-dev-trends-research` branch.

## Phase 2: Apply Strict TypeScript Configuration
*   `[typescript]` Update `tsconfig.json` with recommended strict settings.

## Phase 3: Iterative Refactoring for Type Safety
*   `[typescript][refactor]` Address all TypeScript compilation errors introduced by strict configuration.
*   `[typescript][refactor]` Eliminate `any` types by replacing with explicit types, interfaces, or generics.
*   `[typescript][refactor][test]` For complex type-related refactoring, write a test that highlights the type issue.
*   `[typescript][refactor][test]` Implement the type fix to make the test pass.
*   `[typescript][refactor]` Refactor for clarity and maintainability after type fixes.

## Phase 4: Integrate Clean Code Principles and TDD for New Development
*   `[code-review]` Conduct a review of existing code against clean code principles (meaningful names, small functions, etc.).
*   `[workflow]` Establish TDD workflow: Ensure all new feature development or bug fixes strictly follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle.
*   `[workflow]` Automate code quality checks: Explore integrating linting and formatting tools (if not already present and adhering to zero-dependency) into the development workflow.
